This project aims to address the confusion and uncertainty surrounding UX Design job terminologies by creating a web platform that organizes and simplifies these terms. The platform helps users, particularly new and curious professionals, identify and understand different UX Design positions, enabling them to choose roles that align best with their skills and interests within the industry. The goal is to serve as a comprehensive guide and repository for navigating the diverse landscape of UX Design job titles and descriptions.

## Design Jobs - UX/UI Case Study

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
