This project involved creating an online store to sell a selected physical product, applying principles of usability and UI knowledge to develop a cohesive design system. This includes designing essential website pages like the homepage, product detail page, and checkout process, focusing on color schemes, typography, grids, spacing, and components. The goal is to establish an accessible visual identity that enhances user experience and reflect a coherent design system throughout the online store.
