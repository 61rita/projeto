    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>I Love <span class="words"></span></h2>

    <p>Currently doing an internship at VML and taking a post-graduate degree in Digital Experience Design at the 
        Faculty of Fine Arts in Lisbon.</p>

    <p>Creative and practical, with sharp visual and aesthetic skills, and very focused on customer needs and 
        requirements. I'm also very communicative and tend to make people feel comfortable and motivated around me. 
        I have a degree in Design and previously worked at Associação Portuguesa da Cor, as a graphic designer. I've 
        lived in Oslo, Norway, where I studied Graphic Design for one semester, under the Erasmus+ program, and did an 
        Interrail trough Europe in the summer of 2022 for a whole month, where I was able to visit around 8 cities.</p>

    <p>I've worked alongside many clients such as Fabrica Features, Volvo, Danone, Leroy Merlin, Millennium BCP, Dacia, 
        Chicco, SonaeSierra, Vilamoura and many others. This past year, I also participated in various creativity contests 
        like D&AD and Brief Aberto CCP. Passionate about illustration and Design for as long as I can remember, I love to 
        travel, experience different cultures and I'm always looking forward for new experiences and to get out of my 
        comfort zone.</p>
